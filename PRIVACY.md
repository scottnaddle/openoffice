# IeumOffice Privacy

Last updated: October 14, 2026

IeumOffice opens, edits and saves documents on your own PC. The project runs
no server of its own: nothing is sent to IeumOffice or to its maintainers, and
the app has no usage analytics or telemetry.

Data leaves your PC only in the situations listed below, and each time it goes
directly from your PC to the service named there. This page describes what the
app does; what each of those services does with what it receives is governed
by that service's own terms and by your account settings there.

## What leaves your PC

Every one of these is a direct connection, so the receiving service sees your
public IP address, as any website you visit does.

Parts of a document that you marked as hidden from AI, in the editors that
offer that marking, are withheld from the request whichever provider is used.

## How far hiding reaches

The PowerPoint, Markdown and HTML editors let you hide parts of a document
from AI. The mark is saved in the file, and it is honoured:

- in that editor's own AI panel;
- when the file is read inside the app as material for something else: as an
  attachment in another editor's AI panel, by the home screen's Ask (its
  reads and its search excerpts), in the home screen's search index and the
  excerpts sent for reranking, as material for "Make a new document", and
  by "Convert without AI". A hidden part is read as its label (`{{label}}`),
  hidden text cannot be found by the home screen's search, and a file whose
  marks cannot be processed is not read at all;
- a file open in a tab with unsaved changes is not read for any of these
  until you save it, because a new mark only reaches the file on save.

It does **not** reach:

- **Word documents.** The Word editor does not recognise hiding marks, and a
  `.docx` file read as material (attachment, Ask, search index, "Make") is
  read as written. A Word document whose parts were hidden in the program
  this app is based on sends those parts to the AI provider when you use AI
  on it here.
- **The terminal command, its MCP server and the app's own MCP server.**
  `ieumoffice` commands and MCP tools read PowerPoint, Markdown and HTML files
  as written, hidden parts included. What an agent does with that text is
  up to the agent you run.
- **Three known faults where a mark is lost or not read.** These apply until
  they are fixed:
  - In the PowerPoint editor, if you hide a piece of text that has no
    character formatting of its own, it can be saved without the mark. It
    looks hidden in the open tab, but once you reopen the file, or the file
    is read elsewhere in the app (attachment, Ask, search index, "Make"),
    the text is visible and can be sent to an AI provider.
  - In the Markdown editor, if a part you hide contains inline code, the code
    is saved outside the hidden part. After reopening, or when the file is
    read elsewhere in the app, that code is visible and can be sent to an AI
    provider.
  - A Markdown document saved as `.txt` or `.json` keeps its marks in the
    file, but when you open it again in the Markdown editor, the editor does
    not recognise them and its AI panel sees the hidden text. Read elsewhere
    in the app, the same file stays hidden.

Three more things can cause network traffic that is not a request made by the
app's own features:

- **Install and Sign in buttons.** Install runs the vendor's official install
  command in a terminal window you can see (`irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
  for Claude Code, `winget install OpenAI.Codex` for Codex); the download is
  done by that command, not by the app. Sign in starts the vendor program's
  own sign-in, which opens the vendor's page in your browser.
- **Claude Code and Codex themselves.** They are separate programs from
  Anthropic and OpenAI. The app controls what it hands to them, not what else
  they exchange with their makers; their own terms and privacy policies apply.
- **Documents that point at online content.** An HTML document is a web page:
  when it is shown, it loads whatever online resources its own code refers
  to. Exporting a Markdown document that contains pictures by web address
  downloads those pictures from where they are hosted. The spell checker of
  the Word editor is the one built into the app's browser engine, which may
  download dictionary files from a Google server.

## What IeumOffice never does

- It has no usage analytics and no telemetry: no launch counts, no file
  statistics, no install identifier.
- It never reads, copies or stores your Claude or Codex login: not
  `~/.codex/auth.json`, not the Claude credential store, not a session token.
  It has no Claude or ChatGPT sign-in form of its own. It only starts the
  vendor's unmodified program, which signs in by itself.
- When it asks those programs whether you are signed in, it keeps only the
  program's version, the kind of login (subscription or billed by usage) and
  the plan name. The account e-mail address the programs report is shown on
  the connection card under Settings → AI and nowhere else, so you can see
  which account is signed in. It is held in memory while the app runs and is
  never stored: not in a settings file, a log or a record, and not in the
  output of a terminal command or an MCP tool. The organisation name the
  programs report is discarded.
- The connection card can sign the vendor's program out, or sign it in with
  another account. Both run the vendor's own command and apply to that
  program on the whole PC, so the app asks you first. It still never sees the
  login itself.
- It asks those programs which models they offer, to show their real names in
  the model list. That question goes to the program on your PC; it is not an
  AI request and sends none of your content.
- It never moves your AI chat to a connection that costs money on its own.
  API-key providers, and a Claude or Codex login that is billed by usage, are
  used only after you choose them yourself.
- It does not start AI requests in the background. A request starts when you
  ask for it on screen: in the AI window, or with a button such as AI page
  reading or document translation, which first shows how many requests will be
  sent, to which provider, and whether you will be charged, and sends nothing
  until you press Start. An unfinished job is never resumed by itself; when
  you open the document again, the app only offers to continue. Requests made
  by a terminal command or an MCP client are requests you (or the agent you
  run) made; those can use a subscription only after you switch that on under
  Settings → AI → Advanced. That switch has no hourly cap: an agent can use as
  much of your subscription as it asks for, including whole documents and
  page images.

## Whether your content is used for AI training

IeumOffice does not decide this. When you use a subscription, your content is
sent under your own Anthropic or OpenAI account, and whether it may be used to
train models is set by **your account settings at that company**. Check them
there. The same holds for any API-key provider you add.

## What Claude Code and Codex keep on your PC

- **Claude Code** is started without session persistence, so it does not save
  the conversation to its session files.
- **Codex** is started with conversation-history saving switched off and with
  throw-away (ephemeral) threads. Codex still keeps a diagnostic log database
  of its own on your PC; the project could not inspect what it contains.

## What stays on your PC

Nothing in this list is uploaded by the app.

- **Your documents**, wherever you save them, together with the helper files
  some editors keep next to a document.
- **AI chat history**, kept in the app's data folder
  (`%APPDATA%\IeumOffice`).
- **Settings, including any API keys you entered**
  (`ai-settings.json` in the same folder). The keys are stored as plain text,
  not encrypted, so anyone who can read your user profile can read them.
- **The record that you accepted a login billed by usage**, kept in the same
  folder. It is cleared when the kind of login changes or you sign out.
- **The automatic-call ledger**: the times of subscription requests made by
  terminal commands and MCP clients during the last hour, shown as a count by
  the `capabilities` command. It holds no content.
- **The PDF result store** (`pdf-store` in the data folder): the text the AI
  read from PDF pages, translations together with the provider and model that
  made them, and the progress of unfinished jobs, so that a stopped job can
  continue and conversions can use them. This is document content, kept as
  plain, unencrypted files until you delete it; terminal commands use the
  same folder. Delete it all under Settings → General → **Saved PDF AI results** →
  **Delete all**, or one document's share with **Delete this document's
  stored AI results** in the PDF editor.
- **The search index** of the folders you added to the home screen, autosave
  copies, recent-file lists and local diagnostic logs, also in the data
  folder.
- **Records of which documents were made from which files**
  (`document-links.json` in the data folder), written when a document made
  with "Make a new document" is first saved, and only if its tab actually
  made something: an AI run started there with at least one of the handed-over
  files attached, or a conversion without AI was done there. They hold the
  file paths, the
  time and whether AI was used, not your request. Nothing is written into
  the documents themselves, and the records do not travel with a file to
  another PC.
- **The command-line audit log** (`~/.ieumoffice/cli-audit.jsonl`): one line
  per `ieumoffice` command with the time, the arguments, the result and the
  output path. Set `GENOFFICE_AUDIT_LOG=off` to disable it.

Uninstalling the app does not necessarily delete these folders; remove them
yourself if you want them gone.

## Builds from source and forks

This page describes the code in this repository. A build that someone else
made from modified code can behave differently; the party that distributes it
is responsible for saying so.
